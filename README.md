# Clickbait Challenge 2023 - Spoiler Generation and Spoiler Classification

This repository contains code and resources for the tasks of spoiler generation and spoiler classification for the Clickbait Challenge 2023.

## Task Description

### Spoiler Generation
The goal of the spoiler generation task is to automatically generate concise spoilers that reveal the key content of clickbait posts. Given a clickbait post, the task is to generate a short and informative spoiler that helps close the curiosity gap induced by the clickbait content.

### Spoiler Classification
The spoiler classification task involves categorizing generated spoilers into different types. The aim is to predict the nature or context of the spoiler, such as whether it contains explicit information, vague hints, or contextual summaries.

## Data
The dataset for both tasks is provided as part of the Clickbait Challenge 2023. It includes a collection of clickbait posts along with human-generated spoilers and their corresponding categories.
